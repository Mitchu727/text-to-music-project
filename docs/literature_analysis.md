| Noise2Music | [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.03917.pdf) | NOT PROVIDED | NO | Model parameters were chosen based on genarated results quality. Evaluation were conducted on 16kHz waveforms. To measure the quality of generation, authors used two kinds of metrics: the Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and the MuLan similarity score. Metrics were calculated for these three datasets: MagnaTagATune (MTAT), AudioSet-Music-Eval and MusicCaps  | Inference time for 4 Google Cloud TPU V4 with GSPMD applied (to partition the model, time reduced by more than 50%) ~151s |
